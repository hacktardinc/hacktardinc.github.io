Hey all and welcome once more to my blog. This past weekend i had the privilege to create a forensics challenge for the CyberCon Finals CTF which was held at USIU University. Top 4 Proffesional teams and 10 University teams battled out different challenges ranging from: Web, Forensics, Pwn, Reverse Engineering. Anyway, i didn't have enough time to properly setup a challenge from scratch, so i resolved to create some questions on a memory sample containing some nasty backdoor i was analyzing sometime back. I was happy to see folks solve most of the challenges and almost comming to the same conclusion i had before. With that said, i will be sharing my thought process on how the challenges were meant to be solved.

So, what is a memory dump? Simply put, a memory dump (also known as a core dump or system dump) is a snapshot capture of computer memory data from a specific instant. A memory dump can contain valuable forensics data about the state of the system before an incident such as a crash or security compromise.

> _Memory forensics can provide unique insights into runtime system activity, including open network connections and recently executed commands or processes. In many cases, critical data pertaining to attacks or threats will exist solely in system memory – examples include network connections, account credentials, chat messages, encryption keys, running processes, injected code fragments, and internet history which is non-cacheable. Any program – malicious or otherwise – must be loaded in memory in order to execute, making memory forensics critical for identifying otherwise obfuscated attacks._ ~Source: [DigitalGuardian](https://digitalguardian.com/blog/what-are-memory-forensics-definition-memory-forensics)

First, you unzip the provided memory sample. Password: _infected_

To answer the first question, you were only required to get the md5sum of the `.vmem` file. This was as easy as:

```bash
➜  md5sum malware.vmem
cb47af710c7ab59e43d1396aa7ce950c  malware.vmem
```

Moving on, we can use a tool like [volatility](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility) to analyze the memory dump.

Other tools you can explore on memory forensics include:

- [Rekall Framework](http://www.rekall-forensic.com/)
- [Redline](https://fireeye.market/apps/211364)

First, you need to find more information about the dump you are analying such as the image profile to use. To do so, you can use the `imageinfo` plugin or `kdbgscan`.

```bash
➜  python2 vol.py -f malware.vmem imageinfo
Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6.1

INFO    : volatility.debug    : Determining profile based on KDBG search...

     Image local date and time : 2011-10-10 13:06:54 -0400
```

With that determined, you can begin investigating the processes running on the target system by using the `pslist` plugin.

```bash

No process looks suspicious at this point. We can take this a notch higher and use the `pstree` plugin to print process list as a tree. This would make you understand which process triggered other processes.

```

At this point we see explorer.exe (PID: 1956) spawning `VMwareUser.exe` , `cmd.exe` ( _Suspicious_) , `VMwareTray.exe` & `reader_sl.exe` ( _Suspicious_). My thinking, The user probably opened a malicious pdf file that spawned cmd and finally Adobe reader to view it. We can use the `cmdscan` plugin to extract command history as shown:

```bash
➜  python2 vol.py -f malware.vmem --profile=WinXPSP2x86 cmdscan
Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6.1
**************************************************

ProcessHandle: 0x4c4
Cmd #0 @ 0x4e1eb8: sc query malwar
Cmd #1 @ 0x11135e8: sc query malware
```

We see `sc query malware` command was executed.

> _The `sc` command is used to configure, query, stop, start, delete, and add system services on the Windows command line._

In our case, the command seems to be querying a service called `malware`. The first command entry looks like a typo though.

Similar to cmdscan the `consoles` plugin finds commands that attackers typed into cmd.exe or executed via backdoors. The major advantage to this plugin is it not only prints the commands attackers typed, but it collects the entire screen buffer (input and output). For instance, lets see what output was generated when `sc query malware` command was executed.

More information about the service can be queried using the `svcscan` plugin. This plugin gives more detail to the running processes in the event that the analyst requires additional details such as the display name, binary path, or service type.

Moving on, there was a question asking about the computer name and OS version. This information can be found using the `envars` plugin. Typically this will show the number of CPUs installed and the hardware architecture (though the kdbgscan output is a much more reliable source), the process's current directory, temporary directory, session name, computer name, user name, and various other interesting artifacts.

But what really triggered PID 1956? My hypothesis was that the user opened suspicious PDF documents that led to cmd & Adobe reader spawning. We also saw a network connection linked to this process. Using the `iehistory` plugin we can recover fragments of IE history index.dat cache files. It can find basic accessed links (via FTP or HTTP), redirected links (--REDR), and deleted entries (--LEAK). It applies to any process which loads and uses the `wininet.dll` library, not just Internet Explorer. Typically that includes Windows Explorer and even malware samples. For more info about the same, you can read this [blog post](https://volatility-labs.blogspot.com/2012/09/howto-scan-for-internet-cachehistory.html)

From the above, we see two suspicious pdf documents linked to the same process: `listener.pdf` & `Exploit.pdf`

Lets scan for malicious drivers loaded, and moreso any that contains the `malware` string or name.

```bash
➜  python2 vol.py -f malware.vmem --profile=WinXPSP2x86 driverscan | grep "malware"
Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6.1
Offset(P)          #Ptr #Hnd Start                            Size Service Key          Name         Driver Name
------------------ ---- ---- ------------------ ------------------ -------------------- ------------ -----------
0x0000000001a498b8        3        0 0xf9eb4000     0x1500 malware              malware      \Driver\malware
```

To extract a kernel driver to a file, use the `moddump` pluggin. Supply the output directory with -D or --dump-dir=DIR.

```bash
➜  python2 vol.py -f malware.vmem --profile=WinXPSP2x86 moddump -b 0xf9eb4000 --dump-dir=$PWD
Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6.1
Module Base Module Name          Result
----------- -------------------- ------
0x0f9eb4000 winsys32.sys         OK: driver.f9eb4000.sys
```

We can get its md5sum and check if its flagged by VT

```bash
➜  md5sum driver.f9eb4000.sys
63270d2354695cabde0baeb0aed60e2a  driver.f9eb4000.sys
```

From the [VT - driver.f9eb4000.sys Analysis](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/e0ffcd04beca62d18ef84250c7e39d5e54ed7e0151ab67a819abab92284a17ff), we find 53/71 vendors flagged this file as malicious. We also learn that it linked with R2D2 backdoor.

Running strings on the malicious driver, we find another interesting dll referenced. Doing a quick google search on the same, we still get hits on R2D2 backdoor.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/201756656-4e1936e1-22c9-484f-8682-f23893f0a2a9.png)

Lets find out if the dll is used by `explorer.exe`. To display a process's loaded DLLs, use the `dlllist` plugin with the `-p` or `--pid` filter as shown below.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/201187838-00279ddf-7ba0-46d2-af28-eef7516cd579.png)

From the output shown above, we see `mfc42ul.dll` has a wierd base address compared to the rest (0x10000000). What we can do is extract the DLL from the process's memory space and dump it to disk for analysis as shown below:

```bash
➜  python2 vol.py -f malware.vmem --profile=WinXPSP2x86 moddump -b 0x10000000 --dump-dir=$PWD
Volatility Foundation Volatility Framework 2.6.1
Module Base Module Name          Result
----------- -------------------- ------
0x010000000 UNKNOWN              OK: driver.10000000.sys
➜  md5sum driver.10000000.sys
4986f678160ccd516f2bd589719ea0c4  driver.10000000.sys
```

Doing a quick check on [VirusTotal](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/2b7bbea0b5f8f82c0597e1e710afa2b9f5a0acaf6f46a8fcc62ab103ecb6a319), we see 46/68 flagged this file as malicious.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/201760672-31fefdc6-d807-4be0-be4f-df12792a5678.png)

I did some research on this backdoor and came across this report by the [Chaos Computer Club (CCC)](https://www.ccc.de/en/updates/2011/staatstrojaner), a long-established German hacker group that claimed that the German government may have unleashed a backdoor Trojan Horse program, allowing them to spy on its people. While running strings on the suspicious dll (mfc42ul.dll), i noticed some wierd string, `C3PO-r2d2-POE`. Starwars characters? I don't know.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/201888100-13cb0c93-269c-4d9e-8bf5-1582f7ffda99.png)

From CCC's report, i learnt that the backdoor was dubbed "R2D2" due to the "C3PO-r2d2-POE" string located inside the Trojan. CCC claims that it allows the monitoring Internet activity, including the recording of MSN Messenger conversations, Skype calls and Yahoo messenger chat.

That wraps up my analysis of the R2D2 backdoor, atleast for the context of the CTF. Upon completion of my analysis, I stumbled upon several blog posts documenting analysis of the same sample. Please check them out!
