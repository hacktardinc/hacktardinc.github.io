# Creating network

While in Virtual Box, hold `Ctrl+G` to launch Preference. Alternatively, you can click the `File` tab and select Preference.

Then click the `Network` tab and click the green icon with the `+` sign. You need to create three networks namely: external,internal & secure. In my case, here are the CIDR assigned to each. Also ensure that after creating each network, you enable it by clicking the checkbox.

| Network Name | CIDR            |
| ------------ | --------------- |
| External     | 192.168.20.0/24 |
| Internal     | 192.168.30.0/24 |
| Secure       | 192.168.40.0/24 |

# Creating Virtual Machines

This segment is for people who might be new to creating Windows Virtual Machines. If you already know how to do this, you can skip to []()

Click on `New` icon

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148179921-8c5b08ad-fdaa-46b8-bdbc-317051a88add.png)

Name your Vitual Machine and select the type of Operating system and version of OS you wish to setup.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148048997-2cf3f587-b6c1-4996-b06d-3ec26d173cfa.png)

Allocate the RAM which will be used by the VM. (_2GB is good for quick windows installation if you have minimal resources on your system_)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148049037-8f9673bf-3c90-4e11-8ddb-233f3cd386d9.png)

Choose `Create a virtual hard disk`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148049075-1283bf7b-883f-4b64-bb15-1297965cff1c.png)

Select a virtual disk image

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148049108-4c0230c8-4f18-4e6e-b8f0-6543a2f511e8.png)

Select a Dynamically allocated hard disk file

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148049166-299d7191-59ea-47e2-925c-746d5469e86b.png)

In this last step, you need to allocate the size of the hard disk the VM wil use. In this case, i'll assign 50Gb to each machine.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148049211-f8b3207c-e595-4945-aa0a-1b5a329c5ea7.png)

Do the same for the second Workstation and the Windows Server. I find it a good practice to group my VM's based on the lab exercise at hand. In this case, i've named my group `Pivoting Lab`. You can do so by right-clicking on a machine and click `Group`.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148049893-9df0da28-6686-4296-b46a-c1f4f3c90134.png)

# Os Installation

Boot the Windows Server and accept the EULA

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148054538-765bb18a-4277-4199-9743-09f13e51dbcc.png)

Choose "Custom: Install Windows only (advanced)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148054690-3dc10f33-3b65-4566-86a0-8b330ec831ba.png)

Choose the drive and hit _Next_

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148054778-d6278f2f-09bb-4916-a55f-a4e06ab20e1d.png)

After this step, the installation process begins. Once complete, you will be prompted to input the Administrators password. In this case and for lab purpose, we are gonna setup a "really secure passoword" of `Password123!` and hit next.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148060277-c559c6eb-aeb1-4d2b-b4e1-b080b5687a72.png)

Once you login, you will be welcomed by the Server Manager Dashboard.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148185241-791c27b9-9b10-4454-a982-a2f47b32b6e3.png)

Upto this point, i think we are good to go. Lets proceed to Setup our Windows 10 Workstations.

Choose your region.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148071261-fbb8d428-4898-478b-a567-53ba54c83d29.png)

Select the keyboard layout that suits you.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148071349-fc7c38ae-b04f-45ee-9aa5-237c49a80b7c.png)

For this lab setup, we'll go with _Set up for personal use_

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148072978-8c2394e6-c2b9-4c6d-bccf-3f7a218db9b2.png)

You will be promted to add your account. In the bottom left corner, choose an offline account.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148073162-2924e29d-a97d-46e7-be58-41cd569b4d1e.png)

For now, we'll go with limited experience

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148073238-c7cbfd68-c3a5-42f9-bbe5-836a10e54a31.png)

Input a username for this PC

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148073489-b857d179-4af9-450a-9613-e2ce09b131e0.png)

Enter a password.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148073940-27919e5e-86e5-41fe-b667-4a3fbcd4a039.png)

Creds:

| Workstation | Username   | Password     |
| ----------- | ---------- | ------------ |
| 1           | s.chisholm | FallOutBoy1! |
| 2           | m.seitz    | Phi11i35@44  |

The next step, you need to choose three security questions, so go ahead and do that.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148074408-4f67c512-f546-4694-8dbc-95faf03b5d7a.png)

For privacy settings, we can go ahead and disable all as we don't really require them.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148074533-b54e1a96-0b88-4cc0-bc93-b3f24393115d.png)

And with that done...both workstations should take a moment to load and start.

We also need to ensure that both workstations and the server have the same time settings. To do so, we can head over to `Settings> Time & Language` and ensure that you change the `Time zone` to match your current region.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148100372-1fb87fd3-9b39-461a-b847-d70a10da80eb.png)

# Active Directory generation scripts

Before we can proceed setting up our DC, we need to create a snapshot of all VM's. I find this a good practice incase the script doesn't work as expected, or if it breaks the system, we can easily revert back to the initial state.

To create a snapshot, click the `Machine` tab and select Take Snapshot.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148185878-ecff6c05-fee4-4d6f-8499-5c0b2b86b338.png)

You will then be prompted to enter the snapshot name and a description which is optional.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148186192-2723f1dc-61f8-48f7-9eee-f39bed94011b.png)

Once done, click ok and the snapshot will be taken in a few minutes.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148186295-ffcea020-62fa-4cdb-833b-3774229ac361.png)

For the purpose of this course, rather than manually setting up the Domain Controller, we can use a set of Powershell scripts by [TheMayor/Joe Helle](https://twitter.com/joehelle) which will create a vulnerable environment for us to pentest and learn a few concepts which i will be covering in te next series of blogs. You can download the scripts from this github repo: [dievus/ADGenerator](https://github.com/dievus/ADGenerator) and follow along.

The first script we need to execute is `Invoke-ForestDeploy.ps1`

> This will install the Windows Active Directory Domain Services toolset and generate the actual domain. Follow the instructions on screen, making note of the domain name used as this will be needed later. The scripts are hardcoded for `mayorsec.local` , and any deviation from that domain name will likely break the `ADGenerator.ps1` functionality.

```

Don't mind the warning messages. Once the Server restarts, you will notice that we are already in a domain called `mayorsec`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148214166-06590ba7-997b-4658-b893-65e7fec31d9d.png)

The next step is running the ADGenerator Script. Like we did in the previous step, you need to set the execution policy to unrestricted and invoke the ADGenerator script and run it with DomainName set to `mayorsec.local`.

But before executing the script, i browsed it to see what it does. Here are some of the stuff it does needed for the actual course.

- Group generation - Senior Management, IT Admins, Engineering, Sales
- Domain Information
- Renaming the domain controller to DC01
- Creates a new share called `Shared`
- Creates and adds users to groups
- Allow WinRM TCP 5985 To Domain Joined Systems
- Configuring GPO policies to enable PowerShell remoting on hosts.
- Creating ACL misconfigurations, Kerberoastable service, Administrative privilege delegation and modifying ASREP settings

Lets get into it

# Joining Domains

Starting with the DC, since its on the `Secure Network`, we can give it a static ip of `192.168.40.50`. To do this, we need to go to `Control Panel > Network and Internet > Network and Sharing Center`

Head over to `Setting > Accounts > Access work or school` and click on connect

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148374492-9b503c7c-d6ff-44a2-9ab0-b412e7d7d5cf.png)

In our scenario, we want to join a local Active Directory Domain

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148375003-ddd78211-e4ae-42b7-a1dd-462eb016c76d.png)

Add the domain to join (mayorsec.local)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148375182-e505a4f9-aa93-4f7f-9153-99e251b86ef8.png)

You will be promted to input a user and their password.

Make sure you choose Administrator

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148382225-b87070d2-94a5-4592-8d97-db3e4756cfc7.png)

Once the machine reboots, you'll notice we are now part of the domain.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148383110-72a34419-4cef-4f60-aaf0-8c1bbf753f9f.png)

Repeat this procedure with Workstation2.

If we now go back to our server , launch server manager and on the top right corner, click Tools and select `Active Directory Users and Computers`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148431487-109a5d94-bfb0-4de8-ac9f-9746ef12b3c4.png)

If we click on the Computers tab, we should be able to find both machines listed.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/148431143-78bf8e86-442e-4838-87c1-0b01e84c380e.png)

This names make it hard to identify a specific computer. We can go ahead an use a script called nameGen to automatically rename the PC's. This has to be executed on both machines though. Here is how you would go about it.

We find 3 folders. We are particularly interested in `Shared`

If we navigate further, we can get the script and drag it to our desktop
