#### **Solution**

Let me walk you through my thought process of how i analyzed the email upon receiving it. First, I was at work and didnt have my malware environment available at my disposal to disect the mail. So i downloaded the `.eml` file and used my favourite online sandbox for some quick analysis.([PhishTool](https://app.phishtool.com/)).

Upon loading the file, it rendered as so:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/280507601-9ee88b92-248a-4837-8cb2-1f816135c860.png)

Straight up, I know this was a phishing email.
- I dont own any products that i'm selling ðŸ˜‚
- The attached list was a `.doc` (Items list.doc) - potentially containing malware ðŸš©
- Inconsistent display-name. The 'From' email address local-part `2export` is inconsistent with the display-name `Fatih ALTINDAÅž` provided in the email.
- I looked up the display-name online (`Fatih ALTINDAÅž`) and got a hit on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fatih-alt%C4%B1nda%C5%9F-4b87104b/).

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/280508284-55461410-a286-470b-b1ac-442e2741a2b0.png)

From his profile, there are no records of him working at `megaendustri`. He's also from Turkey. Impersonation? ðŸ¤”

- Doing a quick WHOIS lookup, I learnt that the domain could be legit as it's creation date is kinda old (1999). The company also seems to be in Turkey

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/280508423-9ea214ff-89bf-4096-9258-b75539759bc7.png)

- Confirming if the domain is malicious on [VT](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/url/d3f288c18224ecf1d598eef889b96aaaa10891229972a596552d9870ee0eb730) , I didn't get any hits.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/280508682-0e817b3d-2e4c-42b2-8a79-2c91363bfd05.png)

With that in mind, I proceeded to inspect the document attached. On [VT](https://www.virustotal.com/gui/file/56d16f65b67c4b1ff6e09e36489d507838b92e3ecd8aab44ccbb00e280f933b0) , it had a reputation score of 35/60.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/280508782-4be04a66-2265-4fac-9bcd-e200664c7004.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/280508925-0387cf44-668b-40d4-9fa7-925b6ce51427.png)

Red ðŸš©ðŸš©ðŸš©. 

Lets look at the Originating IP rDNS.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/280511751-d0cb7a75-ce46-4161-ba58-c1fa060e5600.png)

> _When you hear the term "Originating IP rDNS," it's referring to the domain name that is associated with the originating IP address of a network activity, based on a reverse DNS lookup._

Looking at it's WHOIS Records, we realise its origin is still in Turkey.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/280511794-af53c3a9-912f-4ba9-bbc6-b4bbd72d4ff3.png)

Doing a quick lookup on VT i realised the IP is also linked to other uploaded `.eml` & `.msg` files.ðŸš©ðŸš©ðŸš©

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/280511924-58db278c-6163-4da8-b485-68cf2001a7d7.png)

It's JARM Fingerprint is `15d3fd16d29d29d00042d43d00000071784fa9f8305ba9220d0a7894b6ff2c`

I was abit curious what would happen when the document is opened. As i waited to head home to conduct an in depth analysis on my lab, i resolved to [AnyRun](https://app.any.run/), an online malware sandbox environment.

I uploaded the original `.eml` file and manually interacted with the document. A plaback can be found [here](https://app.any.run/tasks/b1aa2ce3-bdd0-4327-8511-119c794b359d/)

Lets start with the process graph.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/280509222-9c12f8e0-e65d-44f0-8b0b-ef0380ec8544.png)


The task involved the execution of several processes, starting with Microsoft Outlook and Microsoft Word. These processes were launched with specific command lines and had parent-child relationships. After the execution of these processes, another executable file named "`arinze963004.exe`" was run twice. In addition to the process tree, there were modifications made to various files and registry keys.

The most interesting event in this task is the execution of the "`arinze963004.exe`" file. This file was run twice, with the second instance being a child process of the first instance. This behavior could indicate the presence of malware, as the file is located in the user's AppData\Roaming directory, which is a common location for malicious files. Another interesting point is the modification of registry keys related to Microsoft Office and Internet settings. These modifications could be an attempt to persist the malware or change the behavior of the system.

Lets take a look at the DNS requests

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/280509795-28115cfc-7550-46ca-9585-d505962fb849.png)

Taking a look at the suricata  rules fired, we see:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/280509872-af66f18b-2593-4bd6-a5b5-494922582b71.png)

One notable rule is `Successful Credential Theft Detected` where an attempt to exfiltrate data via SMTP was made. The process image involved is "`C:\Users\admin\AppData\Roaming\arinze963004.exe`". This event is triggered by a malicious program.
            
Lets disect it. 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/280510373-f0aa8c8c-8f97-48ae-8ffd-eae9f3884111.png)

The process observed is a file named "arinze963004.exe" running in the user's AppData\Roaming folder. It appears to be both the parent and child process. The process is associated with the `AgentTesla` malware, as indicated by the presence of the "`AGENTTESLA`" tag and the detection of `AgentTesla` using YARA rules.

Legitimate programs may read the computer name, environment values, and machine GUID from the registry for various purposes such as system configuration or user identification. They may also access Microsoft Outlook profiles for legitimate email operations. Additionally, legitimate programs may connect to SMTP ports for sending emails.

Malicious programs, like `AgentTesla`, can abuse these actions for malicious purposes. For example, they may steal personal data by accessing and exfiltrating files or by stealing credentials from web browsers. They may also read browser cookies to gather sensitive information. Additionally, they may read the settings of system certificates to bypass security measures or perform man-in-the-middle attacks. The presence of `AgentTesla` in this analysis suggests that the observed process is likely malicious.



Dissecting the process ,we get the malware configuration:

```json
{
  "Protocol": "smtp",
  "Host": "cp5ua.hyperhost.ua",
  "Port": "587",
  "Username": "arinzelog@saonline.xyz",
  "Password": "  7213575aceACE@#$   "
}
```

> _ A malware configuration refers to the set of instructions or parameters that dictate how the malware operates. These configurations can determine various aspects of the malware's behavior, including its communication methods, target information, exfiltration pathways, and more. The configuration is often stored in a structured format, such as JSON, XML, or a custom data structure, depending on the malware's design_

I also observed that the document could be linked to `CVE-2017-11882`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/280510588-7d51797f-1188-4584-a49a-7b36eaa46038.png)

I was abit curious if there are other public submissions of the same exploit in the wild - linked to AgentTesla and indeed its still being actively exploited.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/280510678-79f3c99e-d659-40a9-9726-e490d506af8f.png)

I tracked the CVE on [MALWARE bazaar](https://bazaar.abuse.ch/browse/tag/CVE-2017-11882/) and found recent submissions.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/280510907-a0d47148-94c5-4223-8a5f-97713ed1930c.png)

In summary:

This is a phishing email  spreading the AgentTesla malware. This malware primarily spreads through phishing emails. It has been observed in spear phishing campaigns against multiple different industries, including energy, logistics, finance, and government. it was first seen in the wild around  1 January, 2014 and likely originating from Turkey. This confirms our earlier findings.

### Module: Network Analysis

**Linking the analysis above with the network traffic around that period, can identify what really transpired?**

File can be downloaded here

- How long did it take to capture these packets? (25pts)

`BSidesNBI{00:01:36}`

- What is the victim's IP address? (25pts)

`BSidesNBI{192.168.100.56}`

- An executable was downloaded from a remote server. What is it's md5sum?	(25pts)

`BSidesNBI{d85ad0ba989beb96da04aae8d44add7f}`

- Can you provide the full URI used to download the executable. (25pts)	

`BSidesNBI{http://zang1.almashreaq.top/_errorpages/arinzezx.exe}`

`BSidesNBI{104.21.70.74_172.67.221.26}`

-----

#### **Solution**

To answer the first question, simply load the pcap on wireshark and click on the `Statistics` tab and select `Capture File Properties` or `ctrl+alt+shift+c`

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/280516010-64acba4f-ee25-472e-89f5-ee534d2b916f.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/280515844-9c635dd0-1c40-4d65-abb9-477fd0c5d8a8.png)

Moving on, we can also investigate the IPv4 addresses captured in this traffic. This way, we might identify the victim address. Simply head to `Statistic > Endpoints` and click on the IPv4 tab.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/280516098-783e5e6c-1987-4e28-835f-b7b6337b873d.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/280516228-3a2b4de3-2c48-44c2-a00f-a603e3c2797f.png)

Here we see most packets between `192.168.100.56` (A private IP) and `104.21.70.74` (Public IP). Going a step further, we can also get a glimpse of the protocols captured in this traffic. To do so, click on the `Statistics > Protocol Hierarchy` 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/280516836-cb44efad-9217-4084-bf87-2e6a7eee53ca.png)

HTTP ...

![gif](https://media.giphy.com/media/KIxBn0rcMbhII/giphy.gif)

Filtering for http traffic, we see the local ip identified earlier downloading an executable from the remote server. (hxxp:[//]zang1.almashreaq.top/_errorpages/arinzezx.exe)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/280516673-8863ea15-c0b1-424d-b28f-63bc45f39165.png)

We can export the executable for further analysis by simply: 

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/280517363-20cec1f8-34d0-431e-a2b2-494a9d39de81.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/280517263-ea16268e-c734-4c44-ba36-79d7752cfd51.png)

This is the same executable we saw in our analysis ealier.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/280517522-a37b155c-0572-45c8-a52f-802befa4237a.png)

Inspecting dns queries to the said malicious domain, we see it resolving to two addresses.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/280517913-49ba57d9-6a52-4463-819f-f936a41d3727.png)

We can a step further and inspect the `smtp` exflitration attempt we found earlier. Network traffic consistent with SMTP communication was observed, aligning with the host cp5ua.hyperhost.ua on port 587. Given the context of the discovered malware configuration, it is highly probable that this SMTP communication represents data exfiltration from the compromised system.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/280518897-e497bc0b-76cf-43b8-b703-38a9f7111001.png)

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/280518831-199584f4-4ac9-4df7-b428-85ef234fd1bd.png)

After the `220 TLS go ahead` message, the subsequent lines (with seemingly random characters and periods) represent the beginning of the TLS handshake. This is a binary process where the client and server exchange information to securely encrypt their communication. The text you're seeing is a mix of ASCII representation and raw bytes of this binary data.

Within that garbled text, you can find some readable information about a certificate, such as mentions of "Greater Manchester", "Salford", "Sectigo Limited", and "`hyperhost.ua`". This suggests that the certificate was issued by "Sectigo Limited" for "`hyperhost.ua`", and the organization is likely based in Salford, Greater Manchester.


Generally, this was a very easy and fun challenge. I hope you got to learn a thing or two.
