Hey youüòÖ! Welcome to my blog. Today i will take you through my thought process on how i was able to solve the **"Paranoid"** Challenge on [BTLO](https://blueteamlabs.online/). This is an Incident Response kinda challenge where we are presented with an `auditd.log` file for analysis and recommended to use tools like `aureport` to answer the questions as follows.

Ok...wait..So what's aureport?ü§î

Simply put, `aureport` - _a tool that produces summary reports of audit daemonlogs_

> From the [linux man page](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man8/aureport.8.html#:~:text=aureport%20is%20a%20tool%20that,interpretation%20of%20the%20various%20fields.), _**aureport** is a tool that produces summary reports of the audit system logs. The aureport utility can also take input from stdin as long as the input is the raw log data. The reports have a column label at the top to help with interpretation of the various fields._

This is a command line tool in linux. If your system doesnt have it installed by default, you can install it as follows:

```bash
sudo apt install auditd
```

Someone might ask, what is auditd?

> _Well, Auditd or audit daemon, is a userspace component to the Linux Auditing System. It‚Äôs responsible for writing audit records to the disk._

Once it finishes it will install some tools related to auditd tool. Here are the tools :

- `auditctl` ; is a tool to control the behaviour of the daemon on the fly, adding rules, etc
- `/etc/audit/audit.rules` ; is the file that contains audit rules
- `aureport` ; is tool to generate and view the audit report
- `ausearch` ; is a tool to search various events
- `auditspd` ; is a tool which can be used to relay event notifications to other applications instead of writing them to disk in the audit log
- `autrace` ; is a command that can be used to trace a process
- /etc/audit/auditd.conf ; is the configuration file of auditd tool
- When the first time we install auditd, there will be no rules available yet.

If all goes well, you should be able to run `aureport --help` to see all the available options we can use to parse this log file as shown below:üòÅ

```bash
usage: aureport [options]
	-a,--avc			    Avc report
	-au,--auth			    Authentication report
	--comm				    Commands run report
	-c,--config			    Config change report

	--debug				    Write malformed events that are skipped to stderr
	--eoe-timeout secs	    End of Event Timeout
	-e,--event			    Event report
	--escape option		    Escape output
	-f,--file			    File name report
	--failed			    only failed events in report
	-h,--host			    Remote Host name report
	--help				    help
	-i,--interpret		    Interpretive mode
	-if,<Input File name>	use this file as input
	--input-logs		    Use the logs even if stdin is a pipe
	--integrity			    Integrity event report
	-k,--key			    Key report
	-l,--login			    Login report
	-m,--mods			    Modification to accounts report
	-ma,--mac			    Mandatory Access Control (MAC) report
	-n,--anomaly		    aNomaly report
	-nc,--no-config		    Don't include config events
	--node <node name>	    Only events from a specific node
	-p,--pid			    Pid report
	-r,--response		    Response to anomaly report
	-s,--syscall		    Syscall report
	--success			    only success events in report
	--summary			    sorted totals for main object in report
	-t,--log			    Log time range report
	-te,[end date/time]	    ending date & time for reports
	-tm,--terminal		    TerMinal name report
	-ts,[start date/time]	starting data & time for reports
	--tty				    Report about tty keystrokes
	-u,--user			    User name report
	-v,--version		    Version
	--virt				    Virtualization report
	-x,--executable		    eXecutable name report
	If no report is given, the summary report will be displayed
```

To get a general overview of the provided log file, we can use the `--summary` flag and specify the input file by `-if`.

### What account was compromised? (2 points)

In order to solve this question we can use `-au` parameter to get all the authentication attempts. Simply run

`aureport -au -if audit.log`

Third row displays the `account` info

```bash

```

`btlo`

### What attack type was used to gain initial access? (2 points)

From the timestamps in the output above, we can be able to tell the number of authentication attempts in a span of 1 second are almost 16 times, this definately should be the attacker bruteforcing. He actually got lucky at `10/05/2021 03:22:55` where we see a `yes` in the `success` row.(_Ok, was that last sentence even grammatically correctü§îüòÇ?_) Anyway 17 seconds later, he used the username and password to login and got a pseudo-terminal.

`brute force`

### What is the attacker's IP address? (2 points)

From the output shown above, we can acertain that the IP address must be the attackers

`192.168.4.155`

### What tool was used to perform system enumeration? (2 points)

We can use the `--tty` parameter to get a report on tty keystrokes. Now as shown in the screenshot attached, the attacker run commands like `hostanme` to obtain the DNS(Domain Name System) name and set the system's hostname or NIS(Network Information System) domain name, `whoami` to displays the username of the current user and `ls` to list contents of the current directory. Looking at the `wget` command, we can tell the attacker tried getting linepeas script from his machine which he had hosted it on port `8000`. (_Now from a CTF POV, i kinda related to this whole scenario, whereby if i was solving a machine, lets say on [HTB](https://www.hackthebox.com/), and i've gotten a shell on the target system, i would start by performing some situational awareness to understand more about the system and potentially find ways i can potentially elevate my privileges to a root user._).

So in this scenario, we know that _LinPEAS is a script that search for possible paths to escalate privileges on Linux/Unix\*/MacOS hosts._ . you can read more about some of the enumeration checks it does on [book.hacktricks.xyz](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/linux-privilege-escalation-checklist)

`linpeas`

### What is the name of the binary and pid used to gain root? (3 points)

If we go ahead and follow the output of the previous commamd, we saw that the attacker went ahead and run `lsb_release -a` which is a command to obtain information specific to your LSB (Linux Standard Base) and distribution- specific information. He then went ahead to run `sudo -V` command which basically Prints the sudo version string as well as the version string of the security policy plugin and any I/O plugins (_If the invoking user is already root the -V option will display the arguments passed to configure when sudo was built and plugins may display more verbose information such as default options._). 5 Seconds after determining the sudo verison, the attacker downloaded a compressed file on the target's machine which was still hosted on his machine. Run the `ls` command to confirm it was downloaded successfully then extracted it and navigated to the extracted directory and run the `make` command.

> For those not familiar with the make commnd, i can quote [IBM's Blog](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.2?topic=concepts-make-command) on the same and state that it: "_uses information from a description file, which you create, to build a file containing the completed program, which is then called a target file. The internal rules for the make command are located in a file that looks like a description file._"

With this in mind, we know that there might be some some sort of description file in the current extracted directory. Once the build process completes, he executes a binary called `evil`. With this in mind, we can use the `-p` parameter to list all process id's. In this case we are particularly interested in any information related with `"evil"` binary, so we are going to use `grep` command to filter out uneccesary stuff that we dont really need. We get:

```bash
‚ûú  aureport -p -if audit.log | grep "evil"
16156. 10/04/2021 20:27:17 829992 /home/btlo/evil/evil 59 1001 481021
‚ûú  aureport -p -if audit.log | grep "evil"
```

We can be able to see the pid of the binary as `829992` running from `/home/btlo/evil/evil` path at `20:27:17`. This is 7seconds after the attacker run the command `.evil`, in this case, he run the `whoami` command. If you are still following this, we can can assume that he was checking if he successfully attained root privileges. This brings us to the answer as:

`evil, 829992`

### What CVE was exploited to gain root access? (Do your research!) (3 points)

From the analysis above, we can assume that after running version specific commands after enumeration such as `sudo -V`, he went ahead to search if there are publicly available vulnerability targeting the version he got. From my research, i tried looking for any `"sudo vulnerabilities that you can build with the make command"`. Here is the output i got.

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/58165365/155749440-75607c55-fc87-4ef6-9192-799c50c1a77d.png)

The first result i got was `CVE-2021-3156` dubbed as **Heap-Based Buffer Overflow in Sudo (Baron Samedit)** discovered by the [The Qualys Research Team](https://blog.qualys.com/vulnerabilities-threat-research/2021/01/26/cve-2021-3156-heap-based-buffer-overflow-in-sudo-baron-samedit). From the linked blog post, we can gain further understanding on what sudo versions are affected.

- All legacy versions from 1.8.2 to 1.8.31p2
- All stable versions from 1.9.0 to 1.9.5p1

With this in mind, i used a tool called searchsploit to get an exploit that the attacker potentially used.

`CVE-2021-3156`

### What type of vulnerability is this? (3 points)

`Heap-Based Buffer Overflow`

### What file was exfiltrated once root was gained? (3 points)

Still on the `--tty` output, we saw the attacker tried to clean up by deleting the zip file downloaded and the extracted directory. Assuming he now has root privileges after exploiting the Heap-Based Buffer Overflow in Sudo, he was trying to read contents of the `shadow` file located in `/etc`

> _A shadow password file also known as /etc/shadow, is a system file in Linux that stores encrypted user passwords and is **accessible only to the root user**, preventing unauthorized users or malicious actors from breaking into the system._

So we can be certain that it is the only file he exfiltrated

`/etc/shadow`

That was the end of my blog. Now
